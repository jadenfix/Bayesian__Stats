## 🌟 Core Bayesian Concepts

### 1. **From Statistics to Decisions**
- Bayesian vs. Frequentist paradigms  
- Posterior distributions as belief updates  
- Loss functions and optimal actions  

### 2. **Advanced Probabilistic Modeling**
- **Jensen's Inequality**: Implications for risk assessment  
- **Correlation Structures**: Copulas and dependency networks  
- **Distribution Fitting**: MCMC and variational inference  

### 3. **Computational Methods**
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Risk analysis via sampling  
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Gaussian processes for decision variables  
- **Probabilistic Programming**: PyMC3/Stan implementations

## 🧠 AI/ML Applications

### **Probabilistic Forecasting**
```python
# Bayesian Structural Time Series (PyMC3)
import pymc3 as pm

with pm.Model() as sales_model:
    α = pm.Normal("α", mu=0, sigma=1)
    β = pm.Normal("β", mu=0, sigma=1, shape=3)
    σ = pm.HalfNormal("σ", sigma=1)
    μ = α + β[0]*price + β[1]*ad_spend + β[2]*seasonality
    likelihood = pm.Normal("y", mu=μ, sigma=σ, observed=sales)
    
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000)
```

### **Decision-Theoretic ML**
- Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandits  
- Bayesian neural networks with uncertainty quantification  
- Optimal stopping problems
